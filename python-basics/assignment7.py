'''
ASSIGNMENT:
> Run the code in your PC to see the game's output
> See the problems below, try to solve them
> Ensure you can at least solve the first problem

PROBLEM 1:
> When a character kicks another character, the opponent gets more damage than what the character deals
> Once this problem is solved, the final health of the warrior after taking damage should be 120

PROBLEM 2:
> The function to takle other opponents is not defined.
> Solve the method, then let the warrior character takle the ninja character
> once this problem is solved, the final speed of the Ninja character should be 40

In both cases use the report_status methods to verify of damages are done
